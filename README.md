## Objective 
It is desired to carry out a machine learning project regarding the prices of different types of houses by using the dataset of each house's features and house prices.

## About Dataset
This dataset of residential homes in Lowa, Ames includes 79 explanatory variables.
You can access the dataset and competition page of the project, which also has a competition on Kaggle, from the link below.
Since the dataset belongs to a kaggle competition, there are two different csv files, train and test.
House prices are left blank in the test data set, and you are expected to estimate these values.<br>

## Variables
The Train dataset consists of 1460 observations and 81 variables, and the Test dataset consists of 1459 observation units. Detailed information about the variables can be found on kaggle.

### Note
To run the project, it is sufficient to run the "**python main.py**" command from the terminal in the project directory. The "**--eda**" parameter must be added for exploratory data analysis.
